Mobile applications have become big business in recent years; in fact, statistics show that 21 percent of millennials open an app more than 50 times per day. While there is no denying the popularity of apps, the sheer number of these custom software applications can make it difficult to see results when creating your own apps. With more than 2.2 million apps available for download in the Apple App Store, and an additional 2.8 million in the Google Play Store, it makes sense that your app will have to stand out if you want a lot of people to download it. In the end, it all comes down to app development.
What is app development, though, you may ask? Put simply, app development is the process in which developers create an application to be used on smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. While app development sometimes involves creating a web-based app or a desktop version of the app, the majority of app development projects are deployed to mobile and tablet devices. There are many features and considerations that factor into app development, which will be further explored in this article.
